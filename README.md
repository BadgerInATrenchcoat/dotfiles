# Sway Dotfiles

These are the dotfiles for my Sway + Arch Linux system. The system primarily carries a nord/nord-adjacent theme, with a slightly more lenient approach taken for select elements like Waybar. 

## Dependencies

Below are a series of specific and modular dependencies for the different parts of the dotfiles. If you are interested in a singular portion, then you should be able to simply follow that section. To use them all, however, I have included a one-line `pacman` command to install all of the necessary packages.
